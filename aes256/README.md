# üîê AES-256 Encryption API with FastAPI

This project provides a simple REST API for AES-256 encryption and decryption using the `cryptography` and `FastAPI` libraries.

The encryption is performed in **AES-256 CBC mode** with PKCS7 padding, and the ciphertext is returned as a base64-encoded string (with the IV prepended for decryption).
